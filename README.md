# Banking-EDA-Early-Churn-Risk
Exploratory data analysis of retail banking customer behavior to identify early financial stress and silent churn risk using Python.
# Behavioral Banking Analytics – Early Financial Stress & Churn Risk

## Overview
This project analyzes retail banking customer behavior to identify early indicators of financial stress and silent churn risk using exploratory data analysis and customer segmentation.

## Business Problem
Banks often detect churn too late—after account closure or default. This analysis focuses on behavioral signals that emerge much earlier, enabling proactive customer engagement and risk mitigation.

## Dataset
Synthetic but realistic retail banking customer data including:
- Customer demographics and income
- Account balances and spending behavior
- Credit utilization and overdraft usage
- Digital banking engagement
- Satisfaction and complaint indicators

> This dataset is synthetic and created for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA
- Correlation analysis
- Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering

## Key Insights
- Credit utilization above ~70% is a strong early financial stress indicator
- High income does not guarantee low churn risk
- Declining digital engagement often precedes silent churn
- Customer segmentation enables targeted banking strategies

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only and does not use real customer data.
